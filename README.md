DFC: Distributed File Cache with Amazon and Google Cloud backends
-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

DFC is a simple distributed caching service written in Go. The service
currently consists of a single http proxy (with a well-known address)
and an arbitrary number of storage targets (aka targets):

<img src="images/dfc-overview.png" alt="DFC overview" width="440">

Users (i.e., http/https clients) connect to the proxy and execute RESTful
commands. Data then moves directly between storage targets (that cache this data)
and the requesting user.

## Prerequisites

* Linux or macOS
* Go 1.8 or later
* Optionally, extended attributes (xattrs)
* Optionally, Amazon (AWS) or Google Cloud (GCP) account

The capability called [extended attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes),
or xattrs, is currently supported by all mainstream filesystems. Unfortunately, xattrs may not
always be enabled in the OS kernel (configurations) - the fact that can be easily
found out by running setfattr (Linux) or xattr (macOS) command as shown in this
[single-host local deployment script](dfc/setup/deploy.sh).
If this is the case - that is, if you happen not to have xattrs handy, you can configure DFC
not to use them at all (section **Configuration** below).

To get started, it is also optional (albeit desirable) to have access to an Amazon S3 or GCP bucket.
But if you don't have any Cloud-based buckets, you can first create a local bucket as illustrated
in the **API** section below
and in the [test sources](dfc/tests/regression_test.go). Note that DFC local buckets support the same exact
API as the Cloud-based ones.

## Getting Started

If you've already installed Go, getting started with DFC takes about 30 seconds
and consists in the following 4 steps:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/NVIDIA/dfcpub/dfc
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/NVIDIA/dfcpub/dfc
$ make deploy
$ go test ./tests -v -run=down -numfiles=2 -bucket=<your bucket name>
```

The 1st command will install both the DFC source code and all its dependencies
under your configured $GOPATH.

The 3rd - deploys DFC daemons locally (for details, please see [the script](dfc/setup/deploy.sh)).

Finally, for the last 4th command to work, you'll need to have a name - the name of a bucket.
The bucket could be an AWS or GCP based one, or a DFC-own so-called "local bucket".

Assuming the bucket exists, the 'go test' command above will download 2 (two) objects. Similarly:


```
$ go test ./tests -v -run=download -args -numfiles=100 -match='a\d+' -bucket=myS3bucket
```

downloads up to 100 objects from the bucket called myS3bucket, whereby names of those objects
will match 'a\d+' regex.

For more testing/running command line options, please refer to [the source](dfc/tests/main_test.go).

For other useful commands, see the [Makefile](dfc/Makefile).

## Configuration

DFC configuration is consolidated in a single [JSON file](dfc/setup/config.sh) where all of the knobs must be self-explanatory and the majority of those, except maybe just a few, have pre-assigned default values. The notable exceptions include:

<img src="images/dfc-config-1.png" alt="DFC configuration: TCP port and URL" width="512">

and

<img src="images/dfc-config-2-commented.png" alt="DFC configuration: local filesystems" width="548">

### Disabling extended attributes

To make sure that DFC does not utilize xattrs, configure "checksum"="none" and "versioning"="none" for all
targets in a DFC cluster. This can be done via the [common configuration "part"](dfc/setup/config.sh)
that'd be further used to deploy the cluster.

## Miscellaneous

The following sequence downloads 100 objects from the bucket called "myS3bucket":

```
$ go test -v -run=down -bucket=myS3bucket
```

and then finds the corresponding cached objects in the local bucket and cloud buckets, respectively:

```
$ find /tmp/dfc -type f | grep local
$ find /tmp/dfc -type f | grep cloud
```

This, of course, assumes that all DFC daemons are local and non-containerized
 - don't forget to run 'make deploy' to make it happen - and that the "test_fspaths"
section in their respective configurations points to the /tmp/dfc directory
(see section **Configuration** for details).

Further, to locate all the logs, run:

```
$ find $LOGDIR -type f | grep log
```

where $LOGDIR is the configured logging directory as per [DFC configuration](dfc/setup/config.sh).


To terminate a running DFC service and cleanup local caches, run:
```
$ make kill
$ make rmcache
```

## REST operations

DFC supports a growing number and variety of RESTful operations. To illustrate common conventions, let's take a look at the example:

```
$ curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"what": "config"}' http://192.168.176.128:8080/v1/daemon
```

This command queries the DFC configuration; at the time of this writing it'll result in a JSON output that looks as follows:

> {"smap":{"":{"node_ip_addr":"","daemon_port":"","daemon_id":"","direct_url":""},"15205:8081":{"node_ip_addr":"192.168.176.128","daemon_port":"8081","daemon_id":"15205:8081","direct_url":"http://192.168.176.128:8081"},"15205:8082":{"node_ip_addr":"192.168.176.128","daemon_port":"8082","daemon_id":"15205:8082","direct_url":"http://192.168.176.128:8082"},"15205:8083":{"node_ip_addr":"192.168.176.128","daemon_port":"8083","daemon_id":"15205:8083","direct_url":"http://192.168.176.128:8083"}},"version":5}

Notice the 4 (four) ubiquitous elements in the `curl` command line above:

1. HTTP verb aka method.

In the example, it's a GET but it can also be POST, PUT, and DELETE. For a brief summary of the standard HTTP verbs and their CRUD semantics, see, for instance, this [REST API tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html).

2. URL path: hostname or IP address of one of the DFC servers.

By convention, a RESTful operation performed on a DFC proxy server usually implies a "clustered" scope. Exceptions include querying
proxy's own configuration via `{"what": "config"}` message.

3. URL path: version of the REST API, resource that is operated upon, and possibly more forward-slash delimited specifiers.

For example: /v1/cluster where 'v1' is the currently supported API version and 'cluster' is the resource.

4. Control message in JSON format, e.g. `{"what": "config"}`.

> Combined, all these elements tell the following story. They specify the most generic action (e.g., GET) and designate the target aka "resource" of this action: e.g., an entire cluster or a given daemon. Further, they may also include context-specific and JSON-encoded control message to, for instance, distinguish between getting system statistics (`{"what": "stats"}`) versus system configuration (`{"what": "config"}`).

<a name="ft1">1</a>: This will fetch the object "myS3object" from the bucket "myS3bucket". Notice the -L - this option must be used in all DFC supported commands that read or write data - usually via the URL path /v1/files/. For more on the -L and other useful options, see [Everything curl: HTTP redirect](https://ec.haxx.se/http-redirects.html).

<a name="ft2">2</a>: See the List Bucket section for details. [↩](#a2)

<a name="ft3">3</a>: Notice the -L option here and elsewhere. [↩](#a3)

<a name="ft4">4</a>: Advanced usage only. [↩](#a4)

<a name="ft5">5</a>: See the List/Range Operations section for details.

### Example: querying runtime statistics

```
$ curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"what": "stats"}' http://192.168.176.128:8080/v1/cluster
```

This single command causes execution of multiple `GET {"what": "stats"}` requests within the DFC cluster, and results in a JSON-formatted consolidated output that contains both http proxy and storage targets request counters, as well as per-target used/available capacities. For example:

<img src="images/dfc-get-stats.png" alt="DFC statistics" width="440">

More usage examples can be found in the [the source](dfc/tests/regression_test.go).

## List Bucket

the ListBucket API returns a page of object names (and, optionally, their properties including sizes, creation times, checksums, and more), in addition to a token allowing the next page to be retrieved.

### properties-and-options
The properties-and-options specifier must be a JSON-encoded structure, for instance '{"props": "size"}' (see examples). An empty structure '{}' results in getting just the names of the objects (from the specified bucket) with no other metadata.

| Property/Option | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| props | The properties to return with object names | A comma-separated string containing any combination of: "checksum","size","atime","ctime","iscached","bucket","version". <sup id="a6">[6](#ft6)</sup> |
| time_format | The standard by which times should be formatted | Any of the following [golang time constants](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants): RFC822, Stamp, StampMilli, RFC822Z, RFC1123, RFC1123Z, RFC3339. The default is RFC822. |
| prefix | The prefix which all returned objects must have. | For example, "my/directory/structure/" |
| pagemarker | The token identifying the next page to retrieve | Returned in the "nextpage" field from a call to ListBucket that does not retrieve all keys. When the last key is retrieved, NextPage will be the empty string |
| pagesize | The maximum number of object names returned in response | Default value is 1000. GCP and local bucket support greater page sizes. AWS is unable to return more than [1000 objects in one page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGET.html). |\b

 <a name="ft6">6</a>: The objects that exist in the Cloud but are not present in the DFC cache will have their atime property empty (""). The atime (access time) property is supported for the objects that are present in the DFC cache. [↩](#a6)

### Example: listing local and Cloud buckets

To list objects in the smoke/ subdirectory of a given bucket called 'myBucket', and to include in the listing their respective sizes and checksums, run:

```
$ curl -X GET -L -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"props": "size, checksum", "prefix": "smoke/"}' http://192.168.176.128:8080/v1/files/myBucket
```

This request will produce an output that (in part) may look as follows:

<img src="images/dfc-ls-subdir.png" alt="DFC list directory" width="440">

For many more examples, please refer to the dfc/tests/*_test.go files in the repository.

### Example: Listing All Pages

The following Go code retrieves a list of all of the keys in a bucket (Error handling omitted).

```go
// proxyurl, bucket are your DFC Proxy URL and your bucket.
url := proxyurl + "/v1/files/" + bucket

msg := &dfc.GetMsg{}
fullbucketlist := &dfc.BucketList{Entries: make([]*dfc.BucketEntry, 0)}
for {
    // 1. First, send the request
    jsbytes, _ := json.Marshal(msg)
    request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", url, bytes.NewBuffer(jsbytes))
    r, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(request)
    defer func(r *http.Response){
        r.Body.Close()
    }(r)

    // 2. Unmarshal the response
    pagelist := &dfc.BucketList{}
    respbytes, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
    _ = json.Unmarshal(respbytes, pagelist)

    // 3. Add the entries to the list
    fullbucketlist.Entries = append(fullbucketlist.Entries, pagelist.Entries...)
    if pagelist.PageMarker == "" {
        // If PageMarker is the empty string, this was the last page
        break
    }
    // If not, update PageMarker to the next page returned from the request.
    msg.GetPageMarker = pagelist.PageMarker
}
```

Note that the PageMarker returned as a part of pagelist is for the next page.

## Cache Rebalancing

DFC rebalances its cached content based on the DFC cluster map. When cache servers join or leave the cluster, the next updated version (aka generation) of the cluster map gets centrally replicated to all storage targets. Each target then starts, in parallel, a background thread to traverse its local caches and recompute locations of the cached items.

Thus, the rebalancing process is completely decentralized. When a single server joins (or goes down in a) cluster of N servers, approximately 1/Nth of the content will get rebalanced via direct target-to-target transfers.

## List/Range Operations

DFC provides two APIs to operate on groups of objects: List, and Range. Both of these share two optional parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|--- | --- | --- |
| deadline | The amount of time before the request expires formatted as a [golang duration string](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). A timeout of 0 means no timeout.| 0 |
| wait | If true, a response will be sent only when the operation completes or the deadline passes. When false, a response will be sent once the operation is initiated. When setting wait=true, ensure your request has a timeout at least as long as the deadline. | false |

### List

List APIs take a JSON array of object names, and initiate the operation on those objects.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| objnames | JSON array of object names |

### Range

Range APIs take an optional prefix, a regular expression, and a numeric range. A matching object name will begin with the prefix and contain a number that satisfies both the regex and the range as illustrated below.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| prefix | The prefix that all matching object names will begin with. Empty prefix ("") will match all names. |
| regex | The regular expression, represented as an escaped string, to match the number embedded in the object name. Note that the regular expression applies to the entire name - the prefix (if provided) is not excluded. |
| range | Represented as "min:max", corresponding to the inclusive range from min to max. Either or both of min and max may be empty strings (""), in which case they will be ignored. If regex is an empty string, range will be ignored. |

#### Examples
| Prefix | Regex |  Escaped Regex | Range | Matches<br>(the match is highlighted) | Doesn't Match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "__tst/test-" | `"\d22\d"` | `"\\d22\\d"` | "1000:2000" | "__tst/test-`1223`"<br>"__tst/test-`1229`-4000.dat"<br>"__tst/test-1111-`1229`.dat"<br>"__tst/test-`1222`2-40000.dat" | "__prod/test-1223"<br>"__tst/test-1333"<br>"__tst/test-2222-4000.dat" |
| "a/b/c" | `"^\d+1\d"` | `"^\\d+1\\d"` | ":100000" | "a/b/c/`110`"<br>"a/b/c/`99919`-200000.dat"<br>"a/b/c/`2314`video-big" | "a/b/110"<br>"a/b/c/d/110"<br>"a/b/c/video-99919-20000.dat"<br>"a/b/c/100012"<br>"a/b/c/30331" |
